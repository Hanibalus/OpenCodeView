# Quicksort

Quicksort is a comparison sort algorithm. It has an average performance of O(n\*log(n)) and is generally considered one of the most efficient sorting algorithms.

## Steps

1. Choose any element in the array to be the pivot.
2. Partition the array into sub-arrays:
    - elements with lower values than the pivot
    - elements with greater values than the pivot
3. Recursively apply the algorithm to all partitions
