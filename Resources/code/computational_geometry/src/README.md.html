Computational geometry is a branch of computer science devoted to the study of algorithms which can be formulated in geometric terms.  While modern computational geometry is a recent development, it is one of the oldest fields of computing with history stretching back to antiquity. 

The primary goal of research in combinatorial computational geometry is to develop efficient algorithms and data structures for solving problems stated in terms of basic geometrical objects: points, line segments, polygons, polyhedra, etc.
