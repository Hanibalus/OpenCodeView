# Linear search
The linear search is the simplest of the searching algorithms. 
The goal of the algorithm is check for existence of an element in the given array.

# How it works
Linear search goes through each element of the given array until either the element to be searched is found or we have reached the end of the array. 

# Complexity
Time Complexity -&gt; **O(n)** 

Space Complexity -&gt; **O(1)**
